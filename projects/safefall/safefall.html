        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>SafeFall is a fall detection web application designed to enhance safety for elderly individuals and others at risk of falls. The app leverages computer vision to monitor users through live video feeds. It automatically detects falls in real-time using an AI-powered model and sends immediate alerts to registered caregivers via WhatsApp. Additionally, SafeFall keeps a comprehensive log of all detected incidents, allowing caregivers to review the fall history and assess potential risks.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>As the AI/ML engineer for this project, I was responsible for developing the computer vision model that powers the fall detection mechanism. I trained and fine-tuned the YOLOv8 model to accurately identify fall events based on video input. Additionally, I enabled SafeFall to use smartphone cameras as video input sources, allowing the app to be flexible and easy to use in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, I integrated a WhatsApp notification feature, ensuring that caregivers receive instant alerts whenever a fall is detected.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and Solution</h2>
        <p>Our initial plan was to use IoT cameras to capture video streams, but we faced a logistical issue when we were sent the wrong item during an online purchase. Without the intended IoT camera, we had to quickly find an alternative solution. As the team leader, I pivoted the approach by enabling SafeFall to use smartphone cameras instead. I integrated the IP Webcam app, which allowed smartphones to stream video directly to SafeFall, ensuring the project continued without delays. </p>
